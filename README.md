# Personal Development & Data Engineering Playground #
Welcome to my Personal Development & Data Engineering Playground! ðŸŽ®ðŸ”§ This repository is a collection of all the personal projects, experiments, and concepts I develop or work on, including data engineering practices, tools, and concepts that I use at work (particularly with Databricks, Spark, and other data processing frameworks).

Whatâ€™s in here?
This repo contains a mix of:

Personal development projects: From scripts and small tools to larger experiments.
Data Engineering Workflows: Concepts and prototypes for data engineering pipelines.
Databricks & Spark experiments: Code snippets, notebooks, and workflows built for working with Databricks, Apache Spark, and other related technologies.
General experimentation: Any random ideas I want to prototype, explore, or simply try out.
Technologies Used:
Databricks
Apache Spark
Python
SQL
Jupyter Notebooks
Docker (for containerized experiments)
And more!

And yes, this was very much GPT generated :-)
